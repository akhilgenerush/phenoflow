  NDVI: "Indicates how much healthy, green vegetation is present. Higher values generally mean better plant health and vigour.",
  EVI: "Improves on NDVI in dense canopies and corrects for atmospheric and soil effects. Reflects vegetation health and biomass.",
  GNDVI: "Uses green light instead of red; sensitive to chlorophyll and useful for assessing plant health and nitrogen status.",
